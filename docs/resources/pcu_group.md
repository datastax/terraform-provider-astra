# astra_pcu_group (Resource)

Creates and manages a PCU (Provisioned Capacity Units) group. PCU groups provide dedicated compute capacity for databases in a specific cloud provider and region.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a basic PCU group
resource "astra_pcu_group" "example" {
  title             = "production-pcu-group"
  cloud_provider    = "AWS"
  region            = "us-east-1"
  min_capacity      = 2
  max_capacity      = 10
  reserved_capacity = 2
  description       = "PCU group for production databases"
}

# Create a PCU group with custom settings
resource "astra_pcu_group" "custom" {
  title          = "dev-pcu-group"
  cloud_provider = "GCP"
  region         = "us-central1"
  cache_type     = "STANDARD"
  provision_type = "SHARED"
  min_capacity   = 1
  max_capacity   = 5
  description    = "PCU group for development environment"

  # Disable deletion protection for dev environment
  deletion_protection = false

  # Enable reserved capacity protection
  reserved_protection = true
}

# Create a parked PCU group
resource "astra_pcu_group" "parked" {
  title          = "staging-pcu-group"
  cloud_provider = "Azure"
  region         = "eastus"
  min_capacity   = 1
  max_capacity   = 3
  park           = true

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    update = "30m"
  }
}

output "pcu_group_id" {
  value = astra_pcu_group.example.id
}

output "pcu_group_status" {
  value = astra_pcu_group.example.status
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cloud_provider` (String) The cloud provider where the PCU group will be provisioned (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). This cannot be changed after creation.
- `max_capacity` (Number) The maximum capacity units the PCU group may scale to. Must be at least 1 and greater than or equal to min_capacity.
- `min_capacity` (Number) The minimum capacity units the PCU must be scaled to. Must be at least 1 and greater than or equal to reserved_capacity.
- `region` (String) The cloud region where the PCU group will be provisioned. This cannot be changed after creation.
- `title` (String) The user-defined title/name of the PCU group.

### Optional

- `cache_type` (String) The instance type/cache type for the PCU group. Defaults to 'STANDARD'. Changing this value requires replacement.
- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) When enabled, prevents accidental deletion of the PCU group. Defaults to true.
- `description` (String) A user-defined description for the PCU group.
- `park` (Boolean) When set to true, parks the PCU group and any associated databases, reducing costs. When set to false, unparks the group. Defaults to false.
- `provision_type` (String) The provisioning type for the PCU group (e.g., SHARED, DEDICATED). Defaults to 'SHARED'. Changing this value requires replacement.
- `reserved_capacity` (Number) The reserved (committed) capacity units for the PCU group. Must be at least 0. Changing this value when reserved_protection is enabled will result in an error.
- `reserved_protection` (Boolean) When enabled, prevents accidental reserved capacity unit increases. Defaults to true.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the PCU group was created.
- `created_by` (String) The user who created the PCU group.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the PCU group.
- `org_id` (String) The organization ID that owns this PCU group.
- `status` (String) The current status of the PCU group (e.g., ACTIVE, PARKED, CREATING, TERMINATING).
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the PCU group was last updated.
- `updated_by` (String) The user who last updated the PCU group.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import an existing PCU group by its ID
terraform import astra_pcu_group.example 6c57916e-7bd8-4bb6-b264-bae906c8859f
```
