# DataStax Astra Provider

  This provider allows [DataStax Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/) users to manage their full database lifecycle for Astra Serverless databases (built on [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/))
  using Terraform.

  To get started, log into [Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/register) and create an authorization token (in your organization settings). The provider will prompt you for the token
  on apply if it does not detect it in your environment variable `ASTRA_API_TOKEN`.

  Astra Streaming (based on [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)) is now supported.
